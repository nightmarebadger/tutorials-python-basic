Basic Python examples
=====================

Some quick and dirty basic Python stuff that can be used as examples when
teaching relative (or complete) beginners.

Where applicable, examples will come with
[doctests](http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html).

Unless otherwise specified all examples are written for Python 2.7(.4), with
some examples written for both Python 2.7 and Python 3+ (for instance
[input.py](https://github.com/nightmarebadger/tutorials-python-
basic/blob/master/1_very_basic/input/input.py) and
[input3.py](https://github.com/nightmarebadger/tutorials-python-
basic/blob/master/1_very_basic/input/input3.py)).
